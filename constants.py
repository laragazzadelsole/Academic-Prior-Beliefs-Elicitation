SUBTITLE_2 = """ The Colombia Productiva program aims to broaden the range of firms and sectors that engage in exporting, and aims to do so through improvements 
in the management practices through high-intensity technical assistance to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). 
Firms first receive a visit from a consultant who provides a diagnostic analysis of the business, and recommendations for improvements in five areas:
 quality (getting products to the standard needed for international markets), productivity (methods to reduce production costs), labor productivity 
 (a focus on managing workers to make them more productive), commercial strategy (with a focus on sales strategy and accessing export markets), and
   energy efficiency  (to reduce energy costs of production). \\
    They then receive up to 190 hours of technical assistance delivered over 10 months: 30 hours directed towards general commercial strategy, 
    and 160 hours towards the two of the other four areas in which they have the more room to improve. The final phase is a trade fair (macrorrueda de negocios) 
    organized by ProColombia designed to enable firms to obtain meetings with international buyers, primarily from countries with which Colombia has free trade agreements.
     The program is estimated to have a market value of 40 million Colombian Pesos per firm (approximately US\$ 13,800), with small firms having to pay 3 million COP 
     (US\$ 1035), and medium and large firms 6 million COP (US\$ 2070). \\
     \\
     100 firms (Benefits 2 group) have been selected to receive the full version of this program, and another 100 firms (Benefits 1 group) have been selected 
     to receive the diagnostic phase and attend the trade fair, without receiving the 190 hours of technical assistance. \\
The firms have been in existence for a median of 18 years, with 58 percent of them having exported at all in the last three years. 
At the time of application, firms are doing 36 percent of a list of basic export practices. \\
Firms have a mean of 73 and median of 42 employees, and come from 14 different sectors - the most common being textiles (18%), construction (16%), 
transportation equipment (14%), plastics and paint products (13%), and processed food (10%). \\
\\
    The scope of this survey is to record informative priors of different categories of actors: policymakers, experts and firms, in order to incorporate
them in Bayesian impact evaluation, which is particularly helpful to learn more from expensive new programs tested on relatively small samples."""
SUBTITLE_3 = "The following questions regard the priors on the Colombia Productiva Program."

TITLE_INSTRUCTIONS = '''1. Instructions'''

SUBTITLE_INSTRUCTIONS = '''The following example serves to help you understand the layout and how to answer to the survey questions on the effects of being offered the full Colombia Productiva Program. \\
For each of the questions, you have to allocate probabilities to different intervals, based on the probability that you think a specific event will happen. You cannot allocate more than 100\%. \\
      For instance, suppose to be asked about your beliefs of what is going to be the average maximum temperature in Celsius degrees in your city/town tomorrow. Imagine it's summer and the weather forecast predicts heavy rain in the morning. 
      
    '''
CAPTION_INSTRUCTIONS = '''As illustrated in the table, for example you predicted that there's a 45\% chance of having 25 Celsius degrees, 20% chance of having 26 Celsius degrees and so on. \\
   The bar graph shows the distribution of the probabilities assigned to the different temperatures.  '''

TITLE_QUESTION_1 = '2.	Impact on the Number of Different Products Exported in the Year After the Intervention Begins'

SUBTITLE_QUESTION_1 = '''Products are measured using the 6-digit product classification in the harmonized system for the Andean Community. \\
    Examples of products being exported by these firms include different tropical fruits (e.g. uchuva (cape gooseberry), granadilla (yellow passionfruit), gulupa (purple passionfruit), pitaya (dragonfruit), and tomate de arbol (tamarillo)), cotton t-shirts, long and short trousers for women and children, shirts and blouses of artificial or synthetic fiber, miscellaneous plastic products, and miscellaneous steel products. \\
          In 2017, on average the 100 firms offered the full intervention exported 3.4 different products. This is the average over both exporters and non-exporters, so includes zeros for the half of the firms that do not export. \\
_We want to know how much you think this will CHANGE for the group getting offered the full intervention compared to getting offered just the diagnostic and trade fair, over the first 12 months since firms start their implementation. \\
For example, if you think there is a 40 percent chance the intervention will increase the average number of products firms export by 3.3 to 3.7 products,double click on the cell of the column Percentage corresponding to 3.3 to 3.7 and write 40, and allocate your remaining 60 percent according to what else you think is likely._
'''

SUBTITLE_QUESTION_1_2 = '''
**2.2 What would be the minimum effect size you would want to see in order to consider scaling up this program to more firms?** \\
_Express your answer in terms of number of additional products, e.g. if you would want the 3.4  product average to increase to at least 4.4, you should give 1 as your answer._'''
